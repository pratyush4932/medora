# Medora - Healthcare Management App

Welcome to **Medora**, a revolutionary mobile application designed to simplify and secure healthcare management for patients and healthcare providers. Medora digitizes medical records, enhances accessibility through innovative features, and aims to improve health outcomes globally. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Medora app.

## Overview

Medora addresses the challenges of traditional paper-based medical records—lost files, inefficiencies, and lack of portability—by providing a secure, user-friendly platform. Patients can upload and manage their health data, while doctors gain instant access via QR codes. With AI-driven insights and multilingual support, Medora ensures a seamless healthcare experience.

## Features

- **Secure Medical Record Storage**: Upload and store prescriptions, lab reports, and more in an encrypted cloud, ensuring your data is safe and accessible anytime.
- **QR Code Access**: Generate a unique QR code for doctors to scan, providing instant, read-only access to your medical history without compromising security.
- **AI Chatbot Analysis**: Leverage advanced AI to analyze uploaded reports and receive concise summaries of health conditions, powered by Gemini AI.
- **Medication and Appointment Reminders**: Receive timely notifications to stay on top of medications and scheduled appointments.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [Specify framework, e.g., React Native or Flutter] for a responsive mobile interface.
- **Backend**: [Specify language/framework, e.g., Node.js with Express] for server-side logic.
- **Database**: [e.g., MongoDB or Firebase] for storing encrypted user data.
- **AI Integration**: Gemini AI for chatbot analysis and multilingual translations.
- **Development Tools**: IDX Platform for rapid development, testing, and integration of new features.
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit, compliant with healthcare standards (e.g., HIPAA).
